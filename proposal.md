`5` Create (3-5) User Stories for the base user experience - ( [Reference](https://revelry.co/resources/development/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) )

- As a User I also want to join book clubs to meet other users interested in the same genres/topics as me.

- As a User I want to be able to add discussion posts and comment on other users' discussion posts.
